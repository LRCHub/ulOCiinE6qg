[01:36.87] Woman: Well, they told me, when I have these bad dreams, to try and put
[01:40.41] Endings on the
[01:42.36] Dreams, like I come out a winner. But everytime i try to do that, I
[01:48.68] Just... don't get anywhere. It
[01:52.29] Seems, I keep having the same dream over and over every night, and
[01:59.57] That's why I'm up so late.
[03:36.40] Woman: And I watch one soap opera a day. And if he happens to walk in
[03:40.03] The house, I'm
[03:41.81] Paranoid. I just jump up and turn off the TV. Except he says, "Is that
[03:46.31] All you're gonna do all
[03:47.28] Day, just sit around and watch TV?" And I love to travel, so I've
[03:51.80] Mentioned traveling to him.
[03:53.65] And finances are no problem. But he says that he did all the traveling
[03:57.25] That he wanted to do while
[03:59.05] He was in the service.
