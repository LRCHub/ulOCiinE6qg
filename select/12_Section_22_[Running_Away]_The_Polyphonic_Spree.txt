Let's break it
We take it, we try
Sure, we like it
Shine it, ride it, go

I'm projecting and reflecting desire
For you to come into my life
The rays of this day will not shine there at all
For me and you to get along

It's like running away
With the wind in our face
It's like flying, flying
And you and I are open wide

It's like running away
With the wind in our face
It's like flying, flying
And you and I are open wide

I feel so excited in the line, in today
'Cause you decided to be in my life

It's like running away
With the wind in our face
It's like flying, flying
And you and I are open wide

Let's go, yeah, electric show

I get around the world upon your freeways
It's true, we let it go
I get around the world upon your freeways
It's true, we let it go
