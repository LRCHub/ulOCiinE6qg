[00:04.62] It feels like a perfect night
[00:07.10] To dress up like hipsters
[00:09.59] And make fun of our exes
[00:11.96] Ah-ah, ah-ah
[00:13.96] It feels like a perfect night
[00:16.34] For breakfast at midnight
[00:18.61] To fall in love with strangers
[00:21.17] Ah-ah, ah-ah
[00:27.17] 
[00:23.11] Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
[00:29.72] It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
[00:34.25] Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
[00:38.34] It's time, oh-oh
[00:46.34] 
[00:42.21] I don't know about you
[00:44.15] But I'm feeling 22
[00:46.68] Everything will be alright if
[00:48.83] You keep me next to you
[01:00.33] 
[00:51.66] You don't know about me
[00:53.45] But I'll bet you want to
[00:55.79] Everything will be alright if
[00:58.02] We just keep dancing like we're 22, 22
[01:17.02] 
[01:09.36] It seems like one of those nights
[01:11.87] This place is too crowded
[01:14.15] Too many cool kids
[01:16.27] (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew) Ah-ah, ah-ah
[01:18.60] It seems like one of those nights
[01:21.07] We ditch the whole scene
[01:23.33] And end up dreamin' instead of sleeping, yeah
[01:45.83] 
[01:29.70] We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
[01:34.17] It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
[01:39.05] Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
[01:43.02] It's time, oh-oh
[01:51.02] 
[01:46.60] I don't know about you
[01:48.75] But I'm feeling 22
[01:51.21] Everything will be alright if
[01:53.47] You keep me next to you
[02:04.97] 
[01:56.21] You don't know about me
[01:57.96] But I'll bet you want to
[02:00.58] Everything will be alright if
[02:02.69] We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
[02:10.07] 22
[02:13.11] I don't know about you
[02:15.03] 22, 22
[02:18.03] 
[02:23.11] It feels like one of those nights
[02:25.61] We ditch the whole scene
[02:27.78] It feels like one of those nights
[02:30.11] We won't be sleeping
[02:32.45] It feels like one of those nights
[02:34.85] You look like bad news
[02:37.15] I gotta have you
[02:39.55] I gotta have you
[02:43.68] Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
[02:53.68] 
[02:51.32] I don't know about you
[02:53.42] But I'm feeling 22
[02:55.73] Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
[02:58.08] You keep me next to you
[03:00.83] You don't know about me
[03:02.60] But I'll bet you want to
[03:04.92] Everything will be alright if
[03:07.23] We just keep dancing like we're 22
[03:24.23] 
[03:14.88] 22 (Dancing like)
[03:19.37] 22 (Yeah, yeah)
[03:24.05] 22 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[03:34.55] 
[03:27.89] It feels like one of those nights
[03:30.43] We ditch the whole scene
[03:32.37] It feels like one of those nights
[03:34.96] We won't be sleeping
[03:37.05] It feels like one of those nights
[03:39.53] You look like bad news
[03:41.85] I gotta have you
[03:44.14] I gotta have you
